<!-- [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matobet/verdi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matobet/verdi) -->

A **VER**y **DI**stributed IaaS application prototype using [Redis](http://redis.io/) and [libvirt](http://libvirt.org/).

## Overview

This project was created for the following reasons:
* Creating a more distributed IaaS management application
* Exploring the idea of using Redis for *everything* (as main data-store, distributed RPC, pub/sub, ...)
* Learning the Go language ;-)
